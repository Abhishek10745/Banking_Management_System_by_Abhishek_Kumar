# Banking Management System 
# by Abhishek Kumar

This is a simple Banking Management System that i built using Java and MySQL. It allows users to register, log in, manage their bank accounts, and perform various transactions like debit, credit, and transfer money.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Users can easily sign up and log in using their email and password.
- **Account Management**: After logging in, users can create new bank accounts, check their balances, and manage existing accounts.
- **Transactions**: The system supports debit, credit, and money transfers between accounts.
- **Security**: We’ve ensured that all passwords are securely hashed using SHA-256, and security pins are also hashed for better protection.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher
- **MySQL**: Version 5.7 or higher
- **MySQL Connector**: The MySQL JDBC driver (`mysql-connector-java`) for connecting the Java app to MySQL.
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).

## Setup

Here’s how to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone
    https://github.com/Abhishek10745/Banking_Management_System_by_Abhishek_Kumar_and_Prateek_Pandey
    
    cd
https://github.com/Abhishek10745/Banking_Management_System_by_Abhishek_Kumar_and_Prateek_Pandey
    ```

2. **Create and Set Up the Database**:
    - Create a new database in MySQL:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE banking_system;
        ```
    - Switch to the `banking_system` database:
        ```sql
        USE banking_system;
        ```
    - Run the following SQL script to create the necessary tables:
        ```sql
        -- Create table for users
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS User (
            full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
            password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        );

        -- Create table for accounts
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Accounts (
            account_number BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
            full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
            balance DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
            security_pin CHAR(128) DEFAULT NULL,  -- For storing hashed security pin (SHA-256)
            FOREIGN KEY (email) REFERENCES User(email)
        );
        ```

3. **Configure MySQL Connection**:
    - Open the project files(BankingApp.java) and update the database connection details (`url`, `username`, `password`) to match your MySQL setup.

4. **Run the Application**:
    - Compile and run the Java files in your IDE. Follow the console instructions to register and log in.
    - You can manage accounts, check balances, and perform transactions using the menu options provided in the system.
